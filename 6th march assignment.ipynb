    "What is Statistics in Maths?\n",
    "In Mathematics, statistics concerns the collection of data, organisation, interpretation, analysis and data presentation. \n",
    "The main purpose of using statistics is to plan the collected data in terms of experimental designs and statistical surveys. Statistics is considered a mathematical science that works with numerical data. \n",
    "In short, statistics is a crucial process which helps to make the decision based on the data."

    "Statistics is mainly divided into the following two categories. \n",
    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "In the descriptive Statistics, the Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data. \n",
    "Data is typically arranged and displayed in tables or graphs summarizing details such as histograms, pie charts, bars or scatter plots.\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics are just descriptive and thus do not require normalization beyond the Data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics\n",
    "In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarised we use Inferential Statistics to describe the Meaning of the collected Data. \n",
    "Inferential Statistics use the probability principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample originally comes.\n",
    "Inferential Statistics are intended to test hypotheses and investigate relationships between variables and can be used to make population predictions.\n",
    "Inferential Statistics are used to draw conclusions and inferences, i.e., to make valid generalizations from samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "In a class, the Data is the set of marks obtained by 50 students. Now when we take out the Data average, the result is the average of 50 students’ marks. \n",
    "If the average marks obtained by 50 students are 88 out of 100, on the basis of the outcome, we will draw a conclusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean, Median and Mode in Statistics\n",
    "Mean: Mean is considered the arithmetic average of a Data set that is found by adding the numbers in a set and dividing by the number of observations in the Data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The middle number in the Data set while listed in either ascending or descending order is the Median. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The number that occurs the most in a Data set and ranges between the highest and lowest value is the Mode. \n"

    "Continuous data are in the form of fractional numbers. It can be the version of an android phone, the height of a person, the length of an object, etc. \n",
    "Continuous data represents information that can be divided into smaller levels.\n",
